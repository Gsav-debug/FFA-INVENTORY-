## ✨ You've Successfully Added the Files!

Now let's get your Boss Babe Inventory running:

## 🌐 Option 1: GitHub Pages (Public Access)

### Step-by-Step:
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click **"Settings"** tab
3. Find **"Pages"** in sidebar  
4. Source: **"Deploy from a branch"**
5. Branch: **"main"** 
6. Folder: **"/ (root)"**
7. Click **"Save"**

### Your Live URLs:
```
🖥️ Main App: https://[username].github.io/[repo-name]/index.html
🧪 QR Test:  https://[username].github.io/[repo-name]/test_qr.html
```

## 💻 Option 2: Local Testing

### If you have the files locally:
1. Open terminal/command prompt
2. Navigate to your project folder
3. Run: `python -m http.server 8000`
4. Open: `http://localhost:8000/index.html`

### Or simply:
- Double-click `index.html` to open in browser
- (Some features work better with a local server)

## 📱 Option 3: Direct File Access
- Right-click `index.html` → "Open with" → Your browser
- Right-click `test_qr.html` → "Open with" → Your browser

## ✅ What to Expect:
- **Beautiful pink/purple Boss Babe design**
- **Real QR codes** that scan with your phone
- **Full inventory management** system
- **Add products, track stock, get alerts**
- **Export to Excel and JSON**

## 🔍 Quick Test:
1. Open `test_qr.html` first to verify QR libraries work
2. Then open `index.html` for the main app
3. Add a test product and generate a QR code
4. Scan with your phone to see the magic! 📱

## 🆘 Troubleshooting:
- **QR codes not working?** → Check `test_qr.html` first
- **Styling looks wrong?** → Internet connection needed for CSS
- **Features not working?** → Use local server instead of direct file
